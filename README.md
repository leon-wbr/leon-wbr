### Projects

**[Hitchmap](https://github.com/Hitchwiki/hitchmap-nostr)**  

A decentralized rewrite of Hitchmap using the Nostr protocol. Replaces centralized APIs with Nostr events to map global hitchhiking routes, share route data, and build a community-owned travel knowledge graph.

**[Lightfoot](https://github.com/Trustroots/lightfoot)**

A postal delivery community on Trustroots + Nostr, where handwritten letters travel physically between people. Built around Lightfoot postal boxes worldwide and delivered by travelers using walking, cycling, hitchhiking, sailing, and other low-carbon methods.

**[Dromedary](https://github.com/leon-wbr/dromedary) <sup>open for funding</sup>**

A modular, self-hostable background daemon for apps that need to connect to Nostr – handling email, push notifications, webhooks, automation, and two-way data flows. Designed to make Nostr integration effortless for JS/TS developers.

**[NcryptVault](https://github.com/leon-wbr/ncryptvault) <sup>open for funding</sup>**

A zero-knowledge, client-side encrypted vault for storing Nostr keys and sensitive app secrets. Supports OPAQUE, multi-wrap KEK/DEK design, and pluggable storage. Secure, modern key management for decentralized apps.

**[Nostroots](https://github.com/Trustroots/nostroots) <sup>contributor</sup>**

An initiative to migrate Trustroots.org (100,000+ members) onto Nostr by 2027. The project introduces key-based identity and decentralization to a long-standing hospitality network—while maintaining a seamless user experience.

**[Inertia Adapter for TYPO3](https://github.com/leon-wbr/inertia-typo3) <sup>open for contributions</sup>**

An experimental integration of **InertiaJS** with **TYPO3**, enabling modern SPA-like experiences inside an enterprise CMS. Looking for contributors to help turn this into a production-ready library.
